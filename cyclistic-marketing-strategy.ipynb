Moreno and her team are\ninterested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.\n\n## Step 1: Ask\n\nHow do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n\n* What is the problem trying to be solved?\nThe main difference between the annual members and casual riders according to usage of Cyclistic bikes.\n\n## Step 2: Prepare\n\nFor the purposes of this case study, there is an assumption that the datasets are appropriate and will enable Data Analyst to answer the business questions.
